# Subpar Melee

A two-player arcade game inspired by the classic [Star Control 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Control_II)
Super Melee, but not quite as good. This game is [my entry](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/38/subpar-melee)
to [Ludum Dare 38](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/38/).
